What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","   - Python is a simple and powerful programming language that’s easy to learn, even for beginners. It looks like plain English, which makes it great for writing and understanding code. Python is used for many things like building websites, making games, automating tasks, and analyzing data. Big companies like Google and Netflix use it too. It’s popular because it has a lot of ready-made tools (called libraries) and a huge community to help you.\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","   - An **interpreter in Python** is a program that reads and runs your Python code line by line.\n","   Instead of turning the whole program into machine code at once (like a compiler does), the interpreter checks and runs each line one after the other.\n","   This makes it easy to find errors and test small parts of your code quickly. Python uses an interpreter to help you write and run programs smoothly.\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","   - Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have a fixed meaning in the language.\n","   You can’t use them as names for variables, functions, or anything else, because Python uses them to understand what your code should do.\n","   Examples of keywords:\n","   a. if, else – for decisions,\n","   b. for, while – for loops,\n","   c. def – to define a function,\n","   d. class – to create a class,\n","   e. True, False, None – special values,\n","   f. import – to include code from other files\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n","   They are reserved words that have special meaning in the language, so using them as variable names will cause an error.\n","   Example:\n",""],"metadata":{"id":"14MmGavC7ILQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["if = 10 #This will cause a syntax error"],"metadata":{"id":"8JFpO26M_hDB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["number = 10 # correct way"],"metadata":{"id":"EhsmFnkk_dX1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. What is mutability in Python?\n","   - Mutability in Python refers to whether a value can be changed after it is created. Mutable objects, like lists, dictionaries, and sets, can be changed — you can add, remove, or modify their elements. On the other hand, immutable objects, like strings, integers, floats, and tuples, cannot be changed once they are created. If you try to change an immutable object, Python will show an error. Knowing the difference between mutable and immutable types helps you write better and more predictable code.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"v5RuOWorA1A2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_list[0] = 10  # You can change it"],"metadata":{"id":"urk-Hm8MBKbb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   - Lists are mutable because they are designed to store and change data easily. You can add, remove, or change items in a list after it is created. This makes lists flexible for tasks where data changes over time.\n","   Tuples are immutable because they are made to protect data from changes. Once a tuple is created, its items cannot be changed. This makes tuples safer and faster to use when you want to store fixed data that should not be modified.\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","   - The == operator is used when you want to see if two things are equal in value. For example, two different boxes can have the same toys inside — == will say they are equal because the toys (values) are the same.\n","   The is operator checks if two things are actually the same box, not just the same toys inside. So even if the toys are the same, if they are in different boxes (different objects), is will say they are not the same.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OPD9mWJ6BXcx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["a = [1, 2, 3]\n","b = [1, 2, 3]\n","print(a == b)  # True, because the values are the same"],"metadata":{"id":"WN5JIghwCrKo"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["a = [1, 2, 3]\n","b = [1, 2, 3]\n","print(a is b)  # False, because they are two different objects in memory"],"metadata":{"id":"Mq2W_dP4CuSE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n","    - Logical operators in Python are words that help you combine or change true/false conditions in your code. The main ones are and, or, and not. The and operator is true only if both conditions are true. The or operator is true if at least one condition is true. The not operator reverses the result, turning true into false and false into true. These operators help you make decisions by checking multiple conditions at once.\n","    \n"],"metadata":{"id":"g1t8eubVCyGO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["x = 5\n","print(x > 2 and x < 10)  # True, because both conditions are true\n","print(x < 2 or x == 5)   # True, because one condition is true\n","print(not(x == 5))       # False, because x == 5 is True, but not reverses it"],"metadata":{"id":"b218GiYyDkY6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.  What is type casting in Python?\n","    - Type casting in Python means changing a value from one data type to another. For example, you can turn a number into a string, or a string into a number. This is useful when you need to work with different types of data together or when you want to convert user input (which is usually text) into a number to do math. Python has built-in functions like int(), str(), and float() to help you do type casting easily.\n","    \n"],"metadata":{"id":"oyBHwIy1DybE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["x = \"5\"          # x is a string\n","y = int(x)       # convert x to a number (integer)"],"metadata":{"id":"U8bP8efzEXzS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10.  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","     - Implicit type casting in Python happens automatically when the computer changes one type of data to another without you needing to do anything. For example, if you add a number and a decimal, Python will change the number to a decimal by itself. Explicit type casting is when you tell Python to change the data type using special functions like int() or str(). So, implicit is automatic, and explicit is when you do it yourself.\n","     \n"],"metadata":{"id":"VkgYwnm1Ekd6"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Implicit:\n","x = 5      # integer\n","y = 2.5    # float\n","z = x + y  # Python changes x to float automatically\n","print(z)   # Output: 7.5"],"metadata":{"id":"EfyfwyL0FPa1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Explicit:\n","x = \"5\"\n","y = int(x)  # You change string to integer yourself\n","print(y + 2)  # Output: 7"],"metadata":{"id":"5aRaDXItFSVh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","    - Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of a program by making decisions. They check if a condition is true or false, and then run different blocks of code based on that result. For example, you can use them to decide what message to show, which calculation to perform, or whether to repeat a task. This makes your programs more interactive and able to handle many situations instead of just doing the same thing every time. Common conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","    - The elif statement in Python means “else if” and is used to check multiple conditions one after another. When the first if condition is false, Python moves on to the elif condition to see if that is true. You can have many elif statements to test different possibilities. If none of the if or elif conditions are true, the else part will run if it’s there. This way, elif helps your program choose between many options step by step.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fgoO7-6KFl0i"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["score = 75\n","\n","if score >= 90:\n","    print(\"Grade A\")\n","elif score >= 70:\n","    print(\"Grade B\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Grade C\")\n","  #output - Grade B"],"metadata":{"id":"Uhua_jx6HBoG"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","    - A for loop is used when you want to do something a certain number of times or for each item in a group. For example, if you want to print numbers from 1 to 5, you use a for loop because you know exactly how many times to repeat. A while loop is used when you want to keep doing something until a condition changes. You don’t always know how many times it will run because it depends on the condition. For example, you can keep asking a user to enter a password until they get it right.\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","    - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you don't know how many times a task needs to be repeated. For example, if you're writing a program that asks a user to enter the correct password, you can’t predict how many tries they will need. In this case, a while loop is a better choice because it will keep asking for input until the user types the correct password. The loop runs as long as the condition (wrong password) is true, and stops only when the condition becomes false (correct password).\n","\n","   "],"metadata":{"id":"xhKrcukFHTSJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["password = \"\"\n","\n","while password != \"1234\":\n","    password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n","\n","print(\"Welcome!\")"],"metadata":{"id":"gn2Q-2eeItie"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"UPQWC5LSJAtr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
